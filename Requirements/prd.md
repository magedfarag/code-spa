1.	Introduction

Vision
Our vision for StoreZ is to build a “digital world for Gen Z needs.” We want to create one place where Gen Z can find products and experiences that fit their lifestyle and digital habits.
Problem Statement
Gen Z are the most digital generation, but their shopping is often spread across many platforms. Today’s online stores do not always give them what they want: personalization, interactivity, and content that speaks their language. StoreZ will solve this by offering a single, engaging marketplace made especially for them.
Objectives of This Document
•	Show the vision, roadmap, and main features of StoreZ.
•	Help stakeholders and partners understand the direction of the product.
•	Set the business priorities for the first versions.
•	Prepare the ground for future technical documents with more details.
Approach
We will build StoreZ as a website and mobile app using an agile way of working. This means:
•	We will release features step by step.
•	We will collect feedback from Gen Z users after every release.
•	We will adjust quickly to new trends and technologies.
Document Scope
This document explains the business roadmap and product plan. It does not go deep into the technical side of how to build it. Those details will come later in future documents.

7.	Non-Functional Requirements

Pages and product listings must load quickly (e.g., under 3 seconds) to match Gen Z’s fast expectations.

The platform should handle growth in users, products, and brands without service disruption.

StoreZ should be accessible 24/7 with minimal downtime, especially during peak shopping periods.

•	Usability & Accessibility
Ensure the platform is intuitive, mobile-first, and inclusive for different user abilities and languages (Arabic + English).
•	Maintainability & Supportability
The system should be easy to update, fix, and improve, with clear monitoring and support processes in place.
 
8.	Business Model & Success Metrics

Business Model Style:
StoreZ operates on a B2B2C model. This means we serve two sides of the market:
•	B2B (Business-to-Business): Local brands, small shops, and store admins who join StoreZ as sellers.
•	B2C (Business-to-Consumer): Gen Z customers who shop for curated lifestyle products.
Our platform connects store admins with Gen Z buyers, creating value for both sides: sellers get tools and visibility, while buyers get personalized, trendy shopping experiences.

Revenue Streams:
StoreZ generates income only from the B2B side (store admins). We focus on three main monetization streams:
1.	Monthly Subscription Packages
o	Store admins pay a recurring fee to access the platform.
o	Packages are tiered (basic, standard, premium) depending on the number of product listings, dashboard features, and support.
2.	AI Features as Add-ons
o	Extra paid services such as AI-driven analytics, product recommendations, and sales optimization tools.
o	These are optional add-ons that enhance the store admin’s package.
3.	Store Announcements & Promotions
o	Paid visibility inside the app and platform, such as featured store banners, homepage highlights, or priority placements in product searches.
