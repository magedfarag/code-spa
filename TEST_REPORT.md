## Critical Issues Found & Fixed

### 🔴 CRITICAL #1: Module Version Mismatch (FIXED)
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Impact:** Cart state not persisting, items disappearing after page reload

**Root Cause:**
- `app.js` imported `data.js?v=20251010-imageFix`
- `routes.js` imported `data.js?v=20251010`
- Different query strings caused browser to load data.js **twice** as separate modules
- Each module had its own `state` object instance
- When `loadState()` ran in app.js, it only loaded into app.js's state instance
- routes.js used a different state instance that never got loaded from localStorage

**Fix Applied:**
Updated `routes.js` line 6-8 to use consistent version query string:
```javascript
// Before:
import { ... } from "./data.js?v=20251010";

// After:
import { ... } from "./data.js?v=20251010-imageFix";
```

**Verification:** Cart now persists correctly, badge updates, items display on cart page

---

### 🟡 Issue #2: Cart Badge Not Updating (FIXED)
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Impact:** Users couldn't see cart count update after adding items

**Root Cause:**
`refreshBadges()` function not called after `addToCart` action

**Fix Applied:**
- Exposed `refreshBadges` globally in `app.js` (line 64)
- Updated `window.addToCart` to call `window.refreshBadges()` after adding item

**Verification:** Cart badge now updates from "0" to "1" after adding item

---

### 🟡 Issue #3: PDP Navigation Crash (FIXED)
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Impact:** App crashes when navigating to certain product pages

**Root Cause:**
Array access without null-safe checks:
- `reviewStats.ratingBreakdown[rating]` could be undefined
- `filteredReviews.slice()` could be called on undefined

**Fix Applied:**
Added optional chaining and null coalescing in `routes.js`:
```javascript
// Line 884:
<div>${reviewStats.ratingBreakdown?.[rating] || 0}</div>

// Line 902:
${(filteredReviews?.slice(0, 3) || []).map(review => ...
```

**Verification:** PDP loads without crashes, handles missing review data gracefully

---

### 🟡 Issue #4: Seller Header Overlap (FIXED)
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Impact:** Content hidden under fixed header in Seller SPA

**Fix Applied:**
Added `padding-top: 64px;` to `main#view` in `frontend/Seller/styles.css`

---

### 🟡 Issue #5: Seller Navigation Error (FIXED)
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Impact:** Navigation functions not accessible from inline event handlers

**Fix Applied:**
Exposed `navigate` function globally in `frontend/Seller/app.js`:
```javascript
window.navigate = navigate;
```

---

### 🟡 Issue #6: Buyer Header Icons Overlap (FIXED)
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Impact:** Header controls overlapping on mobile viewports

**Fix Applied:**
Updated `frontend/buyer/styles.css`:
- Made header actions horizontally scrollable (hidden scrollbar)
- Reduced font sizes and padding for mobile
- Limited to 4 visible items on screens < 480px

**Verification:** Header controls now properly spaced, no overlap visible

---

## All Issues Fixed! ✅

### ✅ Issue #7: Product Specifications Display (FIXED)
**Severity:** LOW  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Impact:** Specifications were showing "[object Object]" instead of actual values

**Fix Applied:**
Updated `routes.js` line 827 to handle object-type specification values:
```javascript
typeof value === 'object' && value !== null 
  ? (value[getLang()] || value.en || JSON.stringify(value)) 
  : (loc(value) || value)
```

**Verification:** Specifications now display correct localized values

---

### ✅ Issue #8: Discover Category Filtering (FIXED)
**Severity:** LOW  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Impact:** Category buttons didn't trigger product display

**Fix Applied:**
Updated `searchByCategory()`, `performQuickSearch()`, and `clearSearch()` functions (lines 2198-2229) to force page re-render:
```javascript
if (location.hash === '#/discover') {
  // Force re-render if already on discover page
  window.dispatchEvent(new HashChangeEvent('hashchange'));
} else {
  location.hash = '#/discover';
}
```

**Verification:** Category filtering now properly displays filtered products

---

### ✅ Issue #9: Profile Edit Function Error (FIXED)
**Severity:** LOW  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Impact:** Edit Profile button was throwing `actions.saveState is not a function` error

**Fix Applied:**
Updated `routes.js`:
1. Added `saveState` to imports from data.js (line 6)
2. Changed `actions.saveState()` to `saveState()` in editProfile function (line 2827)

**Verification:** Profile edit now works without errors
```

---

### 🟠 Issue #8: Discover Category Filtering
**Severity:** LOW  
**Status:** ⚠️ OPEN  
**Impact:** Category buttons highlight but don't filter products

**Location:** Discover page, category buttons

**Expected Behavior:**
Clicking "Apparel" should show only apparel products in results

**Actual Behavior:**
Button highlights as active but no filtered products display

**Recommended Fix:**
Add product results rendering to discover route handler when category is selected.
